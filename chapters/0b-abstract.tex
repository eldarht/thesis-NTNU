Smart city development efforts have met hindrances when trying to replicate solutions in other cities. This thesis studies the more general approach of learning and knowledge transfer from the development effort, across cities. It specifically looks at the role of Enterprise Architecture to facilitate learning and knowledge transfer in smart city projects. A literature review and a survey have been conducted to answer the questions of how Enterprise Architecture currently supports learning and how it can be improved in that regard. Further, it applies its findings on The Enterprise Architecture framework used in the +CityxChange project and evaluates the proposed changes with an expert evaluation. It concludes that  the complexity and terminology used in the Enterprise Architecture framework are limiting factors for its use in learning.
