    abstract = {Knowledge architecture (KA) establishes the basic groundwork for the successful implementation of a short-term or long-term knowledge management (KM) program. An example of KA is the design of a prototype before a new vehicle is manufactured. Due to a transformation to large-scale organizations, the traditional architecture of organizations is undergoing fundamental changes. This paper explores the main strengths and weaknesses in the field of KA within large-scale organizations and provides a suitable methodology and supervising framework to overcome specific limitations. This objective was achieved by applying and updating the concepts from the Zachman information architectural framework and the information architectural methodology of enterprise architecture planning (EAP). The proposed solution may be beneficial for architects in knowledge-related areas to successfully accomplish KM within large-scale organizations. The research method is descriptive; its validity is confirmed by performing a case study and polling the opinions of KA experts.},

abstract="Enterprise Architecture (EA) has gained a lot of attention in literature and industry in recent years since it serves as valuable instrument to guide the enterprise through the transformation from a current to a future state by means of providing standardization, rules and principles. This ensures currently the best known way to achieve flexibility, reusability and a common understanding of the enterprise and its functions within the IT domain. The evolvement of EA is best captured by employing a maturity model which indicates the status quo of the EA and provides a means of further improving this evolvement. Several frameworks and approaches have been proposed throughout the years and we conducted an analysis of selected of EA Maturity frameworks in terms of five -- in our opinion crucial - key characteristics. Moreover, as EA covers the enterprise IT holistically on a high level of abstraction, we found an overarching framework available for assessing all of the critical IT functions.",

Interpretive flexibility, the structure of informatic and work process needs and arrangements, and, finally, the dynamic between ill-structured and more tailored uses of the objects. Much of the use of the concept has concentrated on the aspect of interpretive flexibility and has often mistaken or conflated this flexibility with the process of tacking back-and-forth between the ill-structured and well-structured aspects of the arrangements. Boundary objects are not useful at just any level of scale or without full consideration of the entire model. The article discusses these aspects of the architecture of boundary objects and includes a discussion of one of the ways that boundary objects appeared as a concept in earlier work done by Star. It concludes with methodological considerations about how to study the system of boundary objects and infrastructure. }}
